/*
    Rock, Paper, Scissors is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist: ✊), "paper" (a flat hand: ✋), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V: ✌). The earliest form of a "rock paper scissors"-style game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized form, before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th century.

    HOW TO PLAY
    A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, or a loss. 
    1. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who chooses scissors ("rock crushes scissors") = WIN
    2. A player who decides to play paper will beat another who chooses rock ("paper covers rock"); = WIN
    3. A player who decides to play paper will lose to  another player who chooses scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). = LOOSE
    4. If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied. = TIED
    5. Then it will be replayed until there is a winner.
